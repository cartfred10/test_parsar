# test_parser
web page scrapping

from the App users run the file test_parser.php in browser on xampp server etc; 
what the system does is first get product image URL which is 
'productInfoWrapper img and loops through these and displays the image URL, 
similary I used this for productWrapper to get product name and also for pricePerUnit, similary for other elements,
then I have encoded whole content and returns the functions which are defined in simple_html_dom.php for getting json data.
